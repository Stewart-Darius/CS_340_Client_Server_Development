# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves key practices such as modular design, clear and consistent naming, comprehensive documentation, and adherence to coding standards like PEP 8 for Python. These practices ensure that each module has a specific responsibility, improving both understanding and maintenance. The CRUD module's encapsulation of database operations promotes code reuse, modularity, and consistency across the application. This design simplifies maintenance since changes to database logic are centralized. The clear API of the module made integration straightforward, enhancing both development speed and testing. In the future, the CRUD module can be reused in other projects, extended for new features, and adapted to different databases, demonstrating its flexibility and long-term value.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare involved systematic analysis and structured methodologies. This included understanding the project requirements, designing a robust data model, and breaking tasks into manageable components. Unlike previous theoretical assignments, this project required an end-to-end solution involving real-world data. Additionally, this was an introduction to full-stack development as it included both front-end, middle-tier and back-end technologies. Future strategies would include database normalization, performance indexing, and using design patterns like MVC to organize code effectively, making it easier to manage and scale.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve complex problems, design efficient algorithms, and create software systems that drive innovation across various industries. Their work is crucial for modern technology, impacting communication, healthcare, finance, and more. For Grazioso Salvare, developing a database and dashboard streamlined operations and provided valuable insights, improving decision-making and efficiency. This project allowed the company to focus on its core mission without technical challenges, showcasing the significant impact of computer science on enhancing company capabilities and driving innovation.
